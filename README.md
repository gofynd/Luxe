## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (v8 or later)
- fdk-cli
- All the packages in themes node modules

### Installation Steps For development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://GoFynd@dev.azure.com/GoFynd/PlatformThemes/_git/react-starter
   cd react-starter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```

## Project Structure

- **theme/**: Source files including JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, Less, and assets.
- **webpack.config.js**: Webpack configuration file.

## Webpack Configuration

### Entry Points

The entry points are dynamically generated by including all `.jsx` files from the `src` directory:

```javascript
entry: () => {
    const entryFiles = glob.sync('./src/**/*.jsx');
    const entry = {};
    entryFiles.forEach(file => {
        entry[file.replace('src', '')] = file;
    });
    return entry;
},
```

### Output

This specifies that the entry point for the Webpack build process is the `index.jsx` file located in the theme directory.:

```javascript
entry: {
  themeBundle: [path.resolve(context, "theme/index.jsx")],
}
```

### Plugins

The configuration includes several plugins to enhance the build process:

- `MiniCssExtractPlugin`:Extracts CSS into separate files, allowing for parallel loading of CSS and JavaScript.
- `NodeJSPolyfill`: Adds polyfills for Node.js features to ensure compatibility in the browser environment.
- `Overlay`: Provides a development overlay for React hydration, useful for debugging during development.

### Loaders

Various loaders are configured to handle different types of files:

- `babel-loader`: Transpiles JavaScript and TypeScript files using Babel presets.
- `css-loader`: Handles CSS files with support for CSS modules.
- `MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader`: Extracts CSS into separate files, enabling CSS to be loaded in parallel with JavaScript.
- `less-loader`: Compiles Less files, with support for both modules and global styles.
- `@svgr/webpack`: Processes SVG files to be used as React components.
- `asset/resource`: Manages font files and other static assets.

### Optimization

The project uses `CssMinimizerPlugin to minimize CSS files, reducing their size for faster load times in production:

```javascript
  optimization: {
      minimizer: [`...`, new CssMinimizerPlugin()],
    },
```
